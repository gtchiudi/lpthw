Learn Python the Hard Way course
I took this course after completing most of my Computer Science degree at Kent State University.
My main goal in taking this course was to get the basic syntax and symantics of python down as well as the quick introduction to Flask at the end of the course.
The reason many of the exercises are skipped from this course is due to the above: I'm already very familiar with logic and the general idea of programming languages, so many of the lessons on logic were skipped.
